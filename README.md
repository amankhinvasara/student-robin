# Robin Education Student Portal

This project is a Flask web application that serves as the student portal for my non-profit educational organization, Robin Education.
It used a PostgreSQL database to store student data, and HTML/CSS for the frontend.

I used the psycopg2 library to interact with the Postgres database along with flask-login to manage user sessions.
Yagmail was used to automate email messaging.

The primary backend files on the project are app.py and robin_sql.py.
